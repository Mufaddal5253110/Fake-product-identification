# About Fake Product Identification üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
An app which will help to detect whether the product is authenticated or not using blockchain.

## The App has two panel :
* ### Manufacturer
* ### Distributor

*Manufacturer* has the right to create the asset and based upon the unique hash returned after the transaction unique Qrcode is genereted which contains
asset details and the unique hash of the asset.

*Distributor* just need to register himself on the platform,no further functionalities is provided to the distributor,after the manufacturer create the asset he/she assign the registered distributor along with it,then selected distributor recieves the mail regarding the same to deliver the order.

## Then how will the distributor or the consumer can check wether the product is authenticate or not ü§î?
Simply by proceeding to the authentication page where the *Distributor* or *Consumer* can scan the Qrcode pasted on the product and check for the authenticity of the product.

# But why Blockchain?
After going through multiple methodologies and techniques used in the market to ensure authenticity of a product . We came up with a decentralized solution to authenticate the products whether they are real or fake.One of the reasons behind opting for a decentralized system is that it is immutable, so there are no chances of tampering the data and they are public, so there is nothing like secrecy. As it will provide complete transparency to the users, manufactures,vendors and others.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
